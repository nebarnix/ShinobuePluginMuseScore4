# Shinobue Plugin for MuseScore 4

A plugin to add Shinobue Notation text to your music for an 8-Hon choshi
(Other hon choshi can be added upon request)

This adds the text as the first lyrical position. If you want lyrics, then make sure they're in the second or greater (or add them AFTER the notation is added?)

Let's be honest - I have no idea what I'm doing. I adapted the Note Names 3.6 plugin provided with MuseScore 4.0.2-230651553 Windows 64-bit. Feel free to suggest improvements!
